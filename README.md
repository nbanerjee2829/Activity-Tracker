# Activity-Tracker
The Activity Tracker app is a desktop application which will enable the user to track their data and view statistics related to their activities. The tracking app lets you measure and track your runs, walks, and other exercises (e.g. aerobics, cross-country skiing, hiking, biking). Users of the application will be able to import their activities from smart watches/devices (e.g. Apple Watch, Fitbit, Garmin). The Activity Tracker application will provide the user with diverse statistics (e.g. calories used, heart rate, average speed, pace, dehydration, cumulative distance). The user (with permission) will be able to see activities of their friends. .
